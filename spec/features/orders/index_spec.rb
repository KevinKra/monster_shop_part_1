# When I add items to my cart
# And I visit my cart
# I see a button or link indicating that I can check out
# And I click the button or link to check out
# An order is created in the system, which has a status of "pending"
# That order is associated with my user
# I am taken to my orders page ("/profile/orders")
# I see a flash message telling me my order was created
# I see my new order listed on my profile orders page
# My cart is now empty
