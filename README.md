<h3>Project Outline</h3>

  Thank you for taking the time to view our "Monster Shop". This project is dedicated to understanding the functionality 
  behind learning to understand how to build a fully functional online shopping experience. In this project we will outline 
  the methods we used to create User Profiles, Item Capability, Merchant Controlls, As well as a user interface. During this 
  breif walk through we will explain how we came to create the "Monster Shop" as well as the reasons for our coding decisions.
  As always ther is room for improvement. You our user are our best source for progress, we encourage you to leave feedback
  accordingly in the comments section. Again thank you for your time and thank you for choosing Monster Shop! 
  
### Users

  During our creation of the Monster Shop we knew that every person who visited out site would have different needs. As such
  being able to create diffrent user experiences was essential. We began with the functions of log in/log out in order to give 
  different visitors the access they would need to perform the tasks on Monster Shop. 
  
  #### Regular User
  
    Our regular users are our valued customers. The individuals who use Monster Shop to to find the merchandise they need at 
    the price they deserve. In order to become a regular user with Monster Shop all you have to do is provide us with some 
    basic information for sending merchandise and knowing who you are. All it takes is your name, address, email, and a 
    password. At this time Credit Card Charges are not supported. 
    
 #### Merchant User
 
    Our Merchant users are our reliable companies that produce the products that our regular users crave. Merchant users are 
    given certain abilities such as being able to add items to their online inventory. The ability to manage that inventory 
    as they see fit. The same company can have several different log ins!! Delegation has never been easier then with our 
    multi log in merchant profile. Currently bank transfers are not supported. 
    
 #### Admin User
    
    Our Admin users are the organization and stucture of our site. Admin's have the capability to monitor other users! This 
    allows them to make sure that Monster Shop is a plesant place to sell and buy goods. Admin's carry the authority to 
    remove items if they are found to be distasteful in any way. Admins also carry the ability to disable or enable merchants
    and regular users should the need arise. We appreciate all the hard work our Admins put into making Monster Shop a fun and
    friendly enviornment. 
    
### Merchants 

    Our Awesome Merchants are here to sell our customers what they are looking for. As such we have decked them out with every
    thing they need to market their products appropriately. When you visit a Merchants Show page you are able to see there 
    name and address should you want to shop at their actual location!!! We enable all the merchants items to be seen via 
    pictures that the merchant users control! their prices and item descriptions are vived and helpful to support our users in
    finding the best bargan.
    
### Orders

    Orders are organized and secure. allowing for customers to see the quantity of merchandise in stock. Should any of the 
    merchandise run out. the Merchants have the power to disable the item so as not to market it when customers cannot buy.
    this allows for orders to only be built on available product. When the orders are made the Merchant has the ability to 
    mark an order as fufilled and the address of the customer or (regular user) is put in as the shipping address to make 
    checkout a breeze. With our structured order process. Customers get their merchandise right away the first time! 
    
### Code 

    This Section descusses our code and the reasons why we chose to do what we did. During the creation of our code we made
    sure to follow C.R.U.D functionality (Create, Read, Upgrade, Destroy). By doing this we make sure that our code follows 
    a process to keep the application organized and easy for developers to follow. 
    
    While developing the app we followed the process of R.E.S.T (REpresentation, State, Transfer) this clearly shows the 
    M.V.C (Model, View, Controller) flow of the app. When you enter our Models you see relationships, functions and 
    calculations are all apart of our process to make a a strong and easy to follow app. The views hold no calculating methods
    just as the controllers only hold query ability. Our Code is created and maintained in the best possible work flow. 
    
    When we Created out Data Base we used Ruby on Rails which allow us to use the ActiveRecord Language to query the database.
    Our Schema is organized in such a manner that anyone could go in and immediatley see the course of action we take. You 
    can instanly see how defaults and attributes are managed to make the user experience the superior mantal that it is. The
    Password and Cart data is not stored in the data base for our customers security. Instead the method of sessions is used
    to hold that information. Not even an admin user can access another users password. Totally secure. 
    
### Future Plans

    As Developers we believe in progress. Our site can always be better than what it is. A few things that we would like to 
    implement in the furture. Is credit card acceptance and processing, online bank transfers, multiple address options for 
    orders and so much more. We need you our valued users to give us feedback to make the website best for you. Thank you 
    for your continued support.
